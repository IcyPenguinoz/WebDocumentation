			<h2>Research</h2>
      <p>I had conducted not only background research but also key insights into the World Vision organisation, a look into user research with interviews and questionnaires to properly gain better information and awareness of the different user groups that potentially use the World Vision website and had also done proper and informed user profiles following the vast information gained from my user research. 
      <h3 id = "Description"> Organisation Description: </h3>
      <blockquote>
			<p> <em> "World Vision is an Australian charity organisation that focuses towards poverty and injustice within children, families and communities - acting as a global movement in supporting the world.  They are particularly focused on providing short and long term assistance towards vulnerable children and families living in poverty. World Vision uses fundraising and charity efforts in support of their work and overall aim to end poverty." </em> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id = "Key Info"> Key Information and Statistics:</h3> 
      <h4> Introduction Description: </h4>
      <p> The key insights found from the World Vision's website not only gave proper understanding and legitimacy to their cause but it was <b> also later used in the development of my proposal website </b> - whereby I used these <b> key statistics and information to be put and showcased in a better and more visually aesthethic manner </b> for newcomers who do not know about World Vision for <b> my proposed website. </b> </p>   <!-- (as I had looked through the World Vision website and found it difficult to find their impact easily - only being able to find it after going through multiple pages which a regular person would not have the time nor effort for) -->  
      <h4> List of Key Insights: </h4> 
      <ul> 
        <!-- Remember to do citations! --> 
        <li> Overall mission is to <b> eliminate poverty and its causes </b> however they are also more <b> child-orientated or focused, </b> working on their wellbeing</li>

        <li> Aims to also bring "hope and opportunities to vulnerable children and communitiies"  </li> 
        </br> 
        <li> 3.4 million people gained access to clean water through World Vision's work</li>
        </br>
        <!-- Remember to do citations! -->

      <h3 id = "User Justification">  User Research: </h3> 
      <h4> Identification of User Groups: </h4>
      <p> In order to <b> identify and research the users for the World Vision website </b> - an observation and look into the World Vision's social media sites were conducted alongside <b> an article that was used to backup the assumptions of age groups </b> - detailing the demographics on Facebook and Instagram ((Jackson, 2020) showing how Instagram has more younger age groups whilst Facebook has more diverse age groups, with users spanning from young to old - however more older audiences were found on Facebook, whilst on Instagram younger age groups were typically found. As a result of this <b> three user groups were identified: </b> </p> 
      <ul>
        <li> 18 - 24 age group (teenagers) </li>
        <li> 25-50 age group (adults) </li>
        <li> 60-85 age group (elders) </li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      <h4> Secondary Research: </h4> 
      <p> These three main groups were then accompanied by secondary research in the form of <b> a 2019 Australian report (CAF, 2019) </b> giving useful and insightful statistics such as <em> "Those aged 25-34 are the most likely to have made a donation in the last 12 months (74%)." </em> and <em> "For older donors, caring about the cause (64% of those aged 55 years and over vs. 54% average) and trusting the organisations
      they donate to (43% vs. 32%) are more common reasons to give. (CAF, 2019)" </em>  to detail the <b> behaviours, motivations and requirements </b> for mainly the adults and elders age groups.   
      <h4> Primary Research: </h4> 
      <p> This was then followed by more primary research done in the form of  <b> informal interviews with 4 peers </b> around the teenagers age group to gain insights, understanding and motivations within that group as well as creating a <b> survey/questionnaire </b> having meaningful open-ended questions that was distributed on Reddit to appeal to all age groups (being able to <b> gain 10 responses </b> from the Google Form survey/questionnaire I made), providing better understanding and <b> refinement to the motivations, needs/requirements and frustrations </b> experienced by the World Vision donation section of the website in specific as my concept proposal focused on developing on the donation section in specific (more details can be seen in "The Concept" subheading!")</p>
      <h4> </h4> 


			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles:</h3>
      <p> Below are the 3 user profiles/personas that were made following the user research conducted: 
      </br>
      </br>
      <!-- <figcaption><b> User Profile 1 - Young Male Teenager </b> </figcaption> -->
      <img src="User Profile 1.png" alt="Profile1" style="width:100%">

			</blockquote> -->
      <h3 id = "Target User">Target Audience for Website Proposal</h3> 
      <blockquote> 
      <p> Given the exploration of my 3 user profiles/personas - it is most suitable that my target audience is <b> aimed towards young - middle-aged adults (20-35) </b> given how they have <b> expendable income for donating which is the main concept of my website proposal </b> alongside having good knowledge and wisdom on the topic. </p>
      
      <p> The 2019 Australian report (CAF, 2019) also states that <em> “Those aged 25-34 are the most likely to have made a donation in the last 12 months (74%). (CAF, 2019)” </em> - meaning that it’ll make it more likely they would donate to a charity as well known as World Vision. </p>
      
      <p> They would also be knowledgeable on technology/be tech-savvy, giving more freedom for my website design, in exploring different styles and structures - rather than being limited to a really simplistic design had it been targeted to older or younger demographics who are not as well known in technology nor as tech-savvy. </p> 
      </blockquote>
      <section id = "The Concept"> 
      <h3> The Concept </h3> 
      <blockquote>
      <p>The proposed concept idea for my website is to <b> design a data-driven or statistic-driven visualization </b> for my website - showing <b> appropriate and engaging statistics </b> in support of the cause of donating for the World Vision charity. It will provide some key insight towards the organisation’s aim/work, the organisation's positive impact and the benefits they bring in relation to their cause and the website will also follow through with a <b> person’s impact of donating to the cause with corresponding statistics,</b> to visually show the donation impact.</p> 

      <p> NOTE: Given the limitations and my lack on expertise of Javascript - the data visualisation and statistics will be made in Illustrator and used on the website - having unique CSS animations tthat will pop-in or come from the side - in an effort to not make it not too static and mundane. </p>
      </blockquote>
      </section>
    


		<section id="ideation">

			<h2>Ideation:</h2>
			<p>For my ideation process in ideating and developing my ideas for my concept website, I ensured that I had not limited myself to only a couple of ideas but multiple concepts, detailing my decisions and reflective process in choosing according designs in terms of the limitations to coding (no use of Javascript) and the difficulty of doing it alongside balancing it with creativity - to name a few of my design decisions. Below are the <b> moodboards, sitemaps and sketches </b> I conducted during this process. </p>

			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
      <blockquote>
      <p> Moodboards were conducted in being able to properly convey the different styles, colours, website elements/structures and also considerations towards fonts in order to explore a different variety and range of options for my website proposal - instead of being restricted to only one select few. Below are the moodboards I had created: </p> 
      </blockquote>
      <h4> 1st Mood Board: </h4>
			<p>For my moodboards - my first one focused more specifically to supporting the initial idea I had in my head for my website, being one that is a scrollable website using statistics and a nice home landing page/simple colour palette to focus on the idea of donating to World Vision in a more data/statistic immersive manner. The 1st moodboard explored different colour palettes, fonts, navigation bars, website structures/elements/pages and also data elements to help provide better inspiration for my website. 
      <img src="Mood Board.png" alt="Mood1" style="width:100%">

      <h4> 2nd Mood Board: </h4>
      <p> However I have also created and developed a 2nd moodboard to focus on an overall exploration of different styles, as my first one specifically had focus on infographic/website elements as well as a scrollable website structure/some home landing pages, which is quite limited in exploration.
      The 2nd moodboard focused on more nice and simple generalist website designs website elements, as well as some focus on the donation elements that could be implemented from other donation websites and also a specific colour palette (following the exploration of different colour plattes in the first) to give more clarity on my potential website colours. </p>
      <img src="Mood Board 2 NEW.png" alt="Mood2" style="width:100%">
      </br>
        
      <h4> Endnote: </h4>
      These two moodboards provide helpful inspiration and references towards the ideation process and the development of the upcoming sketches, following the development of my sitemaps. This is a result of me being able to explore various rich styles, colours and structures from multiple websites and sources. </p>

      <h3 id ="sitemaps">Sitemaps</h3>
      <blockquote>
      <p> Iterations of sitemaps were done in order to plan out the content that will be used for my website and explore the types of content that I could explore and would be most appropriate to the proposal of my website - a data-driven charity website in support for World Vision. The sitemaps also contained some considerations to website elements for my sketches - making it easier to lead onto doing sketches having some train-of-thought ideas set in stone whilst I did my sitemaps.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h4> Sitemap Introduction: </h4>
      <p> This sitemap iteration I did detailed the overall structure of my sitemap into 3 sections - "Our Impact" showing World Vision's impact to their cause (poverty and children) to legitimise them as a charity organisation, "your impact" demonstrating how the user can help the organisation's cause by donating - showing relevant statistic and infographic elements to demonstrate this and the "Donate now" section as an area to donate - reinforcing the impact of donating via statistics/images (that will be made via Adobe Illustrator on my own and in relevant detail of World Vision's OWN data/statistics to confirm that the data is accurate) in correspondance to the amount set.</p>
      <h5> Sitemap Drawn </h5> 
      <img src = "Sitemap 1 NEW.png" alt = "Sitemap1" style = "width: 100%">

      <h5> Sitemap Digital </h5> 
      <img src = "Sitemap 1 NEW V2.png" alt = "Sitemap1" style = "width: 100%">
      </br> 

      <h4> Sitemap In Detail: </h4>
      <p> The following sitemap I did following my 1st sitemap - followed onto a more elaborate description of the content I wanted to portray in each section in much more detail - alongside some drawings and considerations of website elements, to lead on and assist the upcoming sketching process that follows after a good understanding of my sitemap structure and content.  </p> 
      <img src = "Sitemap 2.jpg" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">

      </figcaption>
      </br>

      <h4> Considerations: </h4>
      <p> There were also considerations towards my sitemaps that I had also thought of as well during my train-of-thought process of considering not only my sitemaps but also somewhat into my sketches (as I wanted to think ahead as well). I had considered the limitations of not using too much Javascript - hence making me orientate towards  simplistic yet direct methods of showing data-driven visualisations without the need for Javascript. The need for clarity in the intended age group I chose (20-35 years old) was also addressed via my emphasis on the impact of the organisation and the person's donation - helping to influence or persuade these target groups in donating via conveying or addressing a sense of trust and legitmacy for the organisation as such.</p>  
      </br>
      <!-- Might do digital version instead? Translate it onto Adobe ILlustrator --> 
      <h4> Overall Sitemap Structure: </h4> 
      <p> Although my sitemap's initial structure looks plain and simple - I had also made another sitemap to showcase the more elaborate details and content for my sections - which takes key insights and details from the sitemap I did in detail:</p>
      <h5> Simple Sitemap Structure: </h5>
      <img src = "Sitemap 3.jpg" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">
      </br>

      </figcaption>
      </br>
      </br>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches:</h3> <!-- Mention also phone layout as well for consideration --> 
			<p>Sketches were done and iterated following the development of my sitemaps - exploring different structures and elements which were inspired from the moodboards I had created - making it much easier to have a better and clear visual image of my website as such. I did multiple sketches for my home landing page and other content pages in order to not restrict myself to one set design.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p> NOTE: My proposed website is going to be a scrollable website (scrolling from top to bottom) - whereby each panel follows one another. For example, going from "Home Page" to "Our Impact" requires a person to slide down OR navigate through the navigation bar (which will bring them down to the selected box/panel - similar to this website's design).</p> 
      </blockquote>


      <h4> Home Landing Page: </h4>
      <p> For my landing page I iterated different designs and structures - with the focus of the home page to use a carousel image slider in demonstrating key insight to World Vision's mission and cause, acting as an introductory segment for newcomers to my website in knowing about the charity organisation. </p> 
      <h5> Landing Page Sketch: </h5> 
      <img src = "Landing Page .png" alt = "Landing Page" style = "width: 100%">
      <p> The main inspirations or developments of my iterations came from 1, 5 and my final decision of panel 6. Further descriptions off this can be seen below:
      <h5> Number 1: </h5> 
      <p> This landing page iteration had design critiques/annotations detailing general areas of improvements that were later implemented into other version (notably Number 5 and Number 6). The main issues I had with this initial design were how there was not enough white space and no proper center of focus on the main image carousel (the middle area)which I wanted to emphasise on, as it entails World Vision's mission and cause. </p> 

      <p> There were also going to initally be statitics at the bottom that looked good in my head but did not seem appropriate - as it draws attention away from the carousel slide, as well as being shown in the next section - "Our Impact". White space and no indication or proper signal that the website continues down were also focused on the 5th and 6th drawing/iteration where I ensured there was sufficient white space and a down arrow to indicate sliding down </p> 
      <img src = "Landing Page [1] .png" alt = "Landing Page" style = "width: 100%">
      <h5> Number 5: </h5> 
      <p> For this iteration, I tried to be unique and have my image slider count (the vertical circles) in a vertical manner, to encourage the motion of how the landing page continues downwards. Whilst this idea could work - it seems hard not only for me to implement code-wise but also for the user who may not be used to images sliding vertically - but rather horizontally as it is the norm or main way to show a image slide carousel. As a result, my final decision (Number 6) incorporated majority of the design format with noticeable  changes, as detailed below:  </p> 
      <img src = "Landing Page [5].png" alt = "Landing Page" style = "width: 100%">
      <h5> Final Decision - Number 6: </h5>
      <p> I decided to go with this design as not only was it simplistic - with the blank white space being the background image - with text showing in the front, but it also incorporated a normal image carousel going horizontally as well as a right arrow on the side (which I forgot to document but will be shown in the "Wireframes" section!) to allow the user to slide past. The bottom bar is also coloured and has a bottom arrow - leading to the next section - "our Impact" in an appropriate manner</p> 
      <img src = "Landing Page [6].png" alt = "Landing Page" style = "width: 100%">
      </br>
      </br>

      <h4> Our Impact Page: </h4>
      <p> The purpose of this page or section (after sliding down from the landing page) was to demonstrate the imapct World Vision has in their cause - demonstrating a world map of their impact globally and statistics/data inforgraphic styles to demonstrate a sense of legitmacy and trust in World Vision. </p>
      <h5> Our Impact Sketch: </h5> 
      <img src = "Our Impact .png" alt = "Landing Page" style = "width: 100%">
      <p> I explored different versions once again but my final decision was a hybrid between Sketch 2 and Sketch 3, with more explanation below: </p>
      <h5> Final Decision - Combination of 2 and 3: </h5>  
      <!-- For hybrid - could draw new version and do annotations of features incorporated from 2 and 3? (could do for other "hybrid" labels as well) --> 
      <p> I decided to go with these two sketches/iterations as they seemed to be simplistic and have sufficient white space - leading the user's eyes to see what they need to see - without any overcrowding elements like in Sketch 1 and Sketch 4, with too much overbearing elements and insufficient white space </p>
        
     <p>As such, I decided to go with the top 3rd sketch element (the World Map and the text) with the 2nd sketch following, after the user scrolls down from the World Map section. This would make it so the user sees the impact World Vision has globally and key insight/statistics to other areas they have brought a positive impact or benefit in. </p>
    
    <p> However I had some issues deciding to do this - as I had considered how it would potentially work on a phone device resolution (as the World Map is relatively big, taking majority of the space with text following) - hence I explored this in the wireframes section to confirm or see how it work on a phone resolution, and in case it had not, I resorted to just simply using the 3rd sketch bottom element (two boxes and text) which would scroll down into the 2nd sketch - to show key insights and statistics to World Vision's impact once again. </p> 
      <img src = "Hybrid Of Our Impact.png" alt = "Our Impact" style = "width: 100%">
      </br>
      </br>

      <h4> Your Impact With Us Page </h4>
      <p> This page was intended to be short yet concise in the benefits and impact the user would bring by donating to World Vision - with my designs focusing on how I can present this information in different styles - being short yet limited or being informative yet too crowded in terms of spacing. These iterations then helped me to decide in doing a combination between 3 and 6, with more exploration below once again:  </p> 
      <h5> Your Impact With Us Sketch: </h5> 
      <img src = "Your Impact With Us.png" alt = "ImpactWithUs" style = "width: 100%">
      <h5> Final Decision - Combination of 3 and 6: </h5>
      <p> I decided to have a combination of my 3rd and 6th sketch - whereby it'll show the 6th sketch first - with the key and important statistics that the user should know before clicking on the donate now option and being directed to (as shown on the bottom) and then an additional right slide (on the right hand side of the website which had not been added but will be shown in the "Wireframes section") which will lead the the 3rd sketch - showing additional statistics and benefits of donating to World Vision as well.  </p>
      <p> The reason behind this is a result of how I believe it gives my users - who are 20-35 years old two options - the first being sliding to the right see more benefits and statistics before being officially persuaded to donate, and the 2nd option being to go straight to donating (with the tab also showing the impact of donating as well - to ensure a sense of legitmacy for the World Vision organisation via the use of real-world statistics)</p> 
      <img src = "Your Impact With Us Hybrid.png" alt = "Landing Page" style = "width: 100%">
      </br>
      </br>

      <h4> Donate Now Page </h4>
      <p>The last and final page and the most important - as it is the main concept of my proposal website (with the last pages being insights, details and persuasion in the user to donate to World Vision) aimed to not only allow a person to donate to World Vision, but also gave options to other specific areas of interests (such as water and education - however I am most likely going to keep it simple and concise for the purposes of simplicity in coding for myself and usability for the users), how often they wanted to donate, the amount they wanted and appropriate images or a carousel of images in showing the impact of donating a specific amount in terms of the cause the user chooses. </p>
      <p> For example, if a person donates $50 for the cause of water, the carousel slideshow will specifically be focused on water, and have an image slide showing how $50 can <em> "help reduce diarrhoea for 38 people a month (World Vision, 2020)" </em></p>
      <h5> Donate Now Sketch: </h5>
      <img src = "Donate Now .jpg" alt = "Donate Now" style = "width: 100%">

      <p> In terms of which design I eventually chose, it's once again a hybrid decision between 2 and 4, with reasoning below: </p>
      <h5> Final Decision - Hybrid of 2 and 4: </h5>  
      <p> With these two donation pages - I decided to go with a hybrid version for my final decision - being that it would be structured in a similar manner to the 4th sketch - however the slider will be replaced by a custom donation input amount. The reason for this is because of how it'll be easier for me to code, alongside how it would allow the person to also customise their amount (in cents as well, for instance: $35.50) in the way they want. The side box (on the right side) will be an image carousel showing the positive impact of donating to the cause they select (via a drop-down menu). </p>
      <img src = "Donate Now Hybrid.png" alt = "Donate Now" style = "width: 100%">
      </br>
      </br>
      <h4> Phone Mockups </h4>
      <blockquote> 
      <p> I also made simple phone mockups adhering to both the final decisions of the home landing page and the "Our Impact" page - helping me to consider phone resolutions throughout the wireframe, mockup and overall website implementation process - considering how content will be appropriate displayed without being too crowded or unnatural. NOTE: Left hand side represents home landing page and right hand side indicates "Our Impact" page</p>

			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>Following the development and exploration of my sketches, I further developed my design via both wireframes detailng the overall structure and form of my proposed website alongside mockups to convey more visual aesthethics and visuals as well.</p>
      </br> 
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      <blockquote>
			<p>Given the extensive and elaborate sketches I did for all of my website's pages - the development of wireframes was relatively easy. However the considerations towards a phone resolution were quite tricky to do - requiring some thinking and experimentation before I figured out the appropriate format. Below are the wireframes I did for my website's pages, which were done on Adobe XD:</p>

      <p> This wireframe aligned to the final decision I had chosen from my landing page sketch - using an image carousel with text in front or within boxes later on - to demonstrate the cause and mission of World Vision in a quick, succinct and efficient manner. It also has a little arrow on the bottom to indicate the user to scroll down or click on the arrow to go to the next section - which is the "Our Impact" section. </p> 
      <blockquote>
      <p> I also considered and will use this phone resolution across my different pages and so when it comes to the coding/implementation stage - acting as a good representation on how I would fit my webpages onto a phone device. I used a hamburger menu as well to ensure the menu would fit on a vertical bar/size for the phone and reduced the text and graphic element sizes to fit on the phone resolution as well. </p>

      <h4> Our Impact Wireframe</h4> 
      <p> In this section - I used two pages to directly demonstrate the impact World Vision has towards their cause via the first page being a world map display with infographics (made in Illustrator) and the side bar showing text about how World Vision works with 100 worlds globally. The 2nd page as a user slides down again - shows additional statistics and information towards their impact once again, demonstrated via boxes and text next to it. It then directs the person to the next section, "Your Impact" after knowing what World Vision can do, as seen on the bottom of the page </p>

      <h4> Your Impact Wireframe </h4> 
      <p> This section is the most elaborate and extensive in terms of data/statistical information - using images, infographic elements and text to demonstrate what the impact of the user's donation is to World's vision cause of poverty and injustice with the 2nd panel or page adding as an additional bonus to convince the user in understanding that World Vision does make use of a person's donation funds in a globally impactful and beneficial way with the statistics to prove it. This would encourage the user to donate and slide down to do so - leading to the final section, "Donate Now". </p> 
      <img src = "Your Impact With Us COMBINED.png" alt = "Landing Page" style = "width: 100%">
      </br>
      </br>

      <h4> Donate Now Wireframe</h4> 
      <p> This final and important section - is where the user can vote for the World Vision charity - being given an option to choose the cause, deciding on how the user is going to pay (once or monthly) and choosing the amount they want. The impact of donating a specific amount (for instance: $15) is then emphasised by the right panel - whereby infographics with the amount by the side, demonstrate the impact a person brings when they donate. An example would be, donating $15 would allow for the better development of water facilities around the world (NOTE: this is an example! Not an actual statistic). There will also be a donate button as well (which is seen in the "Mockups" panel below!) which I had not included to make space and show the necessary details. </p>

      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p> Mockups were the final step conducted - whereby visual aesthethics and colour were added to my wireframes to stylistically experiment and represent the website I'm intending to create - with appropriate images and elements being more visible and easy to notice. It was also during stage that I developed the required and only main images and data/statistics needed for my mockups within Adobe XD like my wireframes.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p> NOTE: Some of the images used (example: the World Map image) are a temporary placement from online (and citated in references area) and are just used to ensure or see how the image fits or looks before creating some of the my heavy images/assets. Also note that the statistics used are accurate and used from the World Vision website! </p> 
      </blockquote>
        
      <!-- <p> Not all the images that I will used for my website were created - only the main ones necessary for my mockups that also show the necessary and appropriate pages as well.</p> --> 
      <h4> Home Landing Mockup </h4> 
      <p> The landing home page mockup is a simplistic image carousel that slides across when the person clicks on the right arrow or on the next concurrent bubble (after the grey one). I was also able to create a nice navigation bar that would be easy to use and conveys the "Donate Now" button in a clear and persuading manner - being coloured in green. Going down leads to the next page - "Our Impact" being clearly indicated on the bottom of the page. </p> 
      
      <p> The use of grey as the background, tinges of orange for the top and bottom of the pages and overall black/white for textual and graphical elements were also visual aesthethics used - being simplistic and not too overbearing, allowing for a smooth flowing and consistent layout and style.</p>  
      <blockquote>
      <p> I also consciously made the bottom colours become a brighter orange overtime (from the home landing page being soft orange tinge to a bright orange by the end of the sections (at the donation section) to subtly demonstrate progression of the pages as a user scrolls down, acting as a neat and nifty feature, taking the colour shading inspiration from my wireframes. </p> 
      <p> A phone mockup was also made - showing similar form with my wireframe - but incorporating colour to accurately lead the user's eyes to where they should look (e.g bottom of page to scroll down and scroll bar to indicate sliding images) and the sliding bar being moved relative to the text to make for a structurally aesthethic landing page </p> 
      </blockquote>

      <h4> Our Impact Mockup </h4> 
      <p> This section of the mockups focuses on portraying a world map - that shows the areas World Vision operates in and will have infographic elements within the image, alongside more information and statistical data - shown in the form of images and text, as the person slides down from the World Map section, allowing them to see the impact World Vision brings - being more emphasised also in the "Your Impact" section which follows after </p> 
      <!-- Try to find digital map image for reference -->

      </br>
      </br>

      <h4> Your Impact Mockup </h4>
      <p> This mockup section contains the most data, statistics and information to emphasise the benefits that comes along with donating to World Vision - with statistics such as <em> "72% of our funds come from the Australian community" </em> helping to elaborately convey and show the actions World Vision brings and does for the world, when the user donates to them. This once again - legitimises and helps my target audience of 20-35 year olds, to gain a sense of trust for them, and as a result become inclined to click on the "Donate Now" button on the bottom of the page after knowing all the full details and information. </p>  
      <img src = "Your Impact With Us Moodboard.png" alt = "Landing Page" style = "width: 100%">

      </br>
      </br>

      <h4> Donate Now Mockup </h4> 
      <p> The final mockup section - visually portrays how a person can select a cause (which is water in this example and will contain of water, education and general donation in the final design), select the amount they want/customise the amount they want (via a custom input) and also see the impact of donating different amounts ($25, $50, $100) on the right handside - which shows a carousel slider of the benefits of donating for the cause they choose. I also decided to remove the type of payment they want (once, monthly) - because it would be too much work to do and code - as the World Vision website shows different benefits for donating once and donating monthly. </p>
