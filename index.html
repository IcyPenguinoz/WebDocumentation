        <h3 id = "Design_Changes">Design Changes and Iteration</h3>
        <h4> From 8 pages to 5 pages:</h4>
        <p>The proper changes of my web iterations were done in accordance to the need for only 5 pages (in accordance to the marking criteria) and hence the reduction from 8 pages to 5 pages were done, alongside considerations of mobile device resolution (to which whilst were considered and designed nicely, had not been properly addressed in the final prototype/design as discussed more in the self-reflection/conclusion stage of this documentation). </p>
          
        <p> The format of doing it as a 'single page' approach also provided for easier and simplistic navigation - combining what could've been multiple pages into 1 long scrolling page allowing for once again, simple easy and aesthethic design. Whilst this also counted as one page (when I had originally perceived it as each scrolling page being a page) there was also an additional page in the donation section - whereby the link to a seperate donation form helped people can focus on the goal of donating - being likely to follow the call to action to donate as a result. Below demonstrates the image comparisons from 8 pages to 5 pages. </p>

        <blockquote>
        <figcaption> NOTE: Whilst I had perceived it as being 5 pages (as as a result of me perceiving each scrolling page to be a page) - there were technically only 2 pages - 1 being the long-scrolling page and also the other donation form page - still following the assessment criteria accordingly however! </figcaption>

        <h3> Mobile Considerations </h3> 
        <p> When it came to mobile ratios/resolutions - proper refined mockups for it were also done following the creation of the 5 pages, in order to visually see and organise the content in an according manner for it. Whilst these considerations were useful and helpful towards the proceeding coding stages, it was however not done properly - further discussed in my <b> self-reflection stage </b> at the end, whereby in simple terms, it was a result of me not doing perhaps a mobile format first and then website (or the website code not being functional enough for other formats alongside time constraints). Below is an image of the mobile mockups being done in a neat and organised manner (with text being aligned appropriately and also the menu being changed to a hamburger menu upon decreasing width size) </p>
        </br> 
        <h4> Mobile Format </h4> 
        <img src = "Mobile Format.png" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">
        
        <blockquote>
        <figcaption> These mobile mockups helped to properly conceptualise and show how to make my mobile and other resolution formats but however were not properly implemented as a result of time constraints and issues with HTML/CSS formatting as mentioned above, but they were overall a good addition to pre-plan how to show elements on smaller resolutions that are not desktop versions/resolutions</figcaption>

      <section> 
      <h3 id = "Code_Sequence">Web Proposal Code Sequence</h2>
      <p>Before properly doing my website code - I had created a simple format to entail how to code the website proposal in an efficient and productive manner. The format included of making my basic format for the one-page scroll first (via adding appropriate div sections to split up the content to fit on 1 page size) to appropriately get the basic layout, then moving towards developing the individual pages following the basic formatting (e.g. working with the home and nav bar and then moving onto the appropriate other pages) and also doing mobile pages incrementally as each page is done. For instance when the home page is done - make it responsive to mobile versions - via use of media queries and referring to the mobile consideration images from the last section. </p> 
      
      <blockquote> 
      <p> Whilst I followed majority of this stage - I had however failed to compromise with the mobile format/other resolution size formats later on as it became too tricky to implement given time constraints and the lack of autonomous and responsive code within the HTML formatting. As such for the future - it would be better to consider this beforehand - and perhaps experiment on individiual pages before moving onto the normal one-apge scroll section </p>
      </blockquote> 
      <h4> Code Sequence </h4>
      <img src = "Sequence of Code.png" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">
      </br>
      <blockquote>
        <figcaption> This process helped majorly towards a good workflow for coding my web proposal - as without it I would've done it without any proper structure - potentially not making the intended website look, aesthethic and structure as I have now. However for future reference, the need for proper mobile resolution/responsive designs needs to be addressed clearly or done in action whilst coding as shown by the diagram of the code sequence, as a way to attract other users on other devices as well as being overall good codeflow and practice.</figcaption>
      </blockquote>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id = "Home_Page">Home Page Process </h2>
        <p>The process behind the development of the home page was relatively simple and was the introduction of also being able to do my mobile resolution/hamburger menu implementation properly via the use of media queries and further discussed in the next section. In the end - the home page had looked very similar to the proposed one but however had no arrow option on the bottom (due to time-constraint alongside how I wanted the user to focus on using the navigation bar more or scroll down to appreciate the simple design) but the same pastal colours were used in accordance to the principle of similarity in colour theory - which in this case was used to match the orange aesthethics from the World Vision logo and style. </p> 
        <p> The according images shows the home page (without the bottom rectangle as it was added later on in the end section following the creation of all the pages but the HTML code shows the code snippet used for this) with also a new font - which was "Montserrat" as it had a professional and nice look to it - alongside the according HTML and CSS code - with my new understanding of the "::before" and "::after" tags in css to accordingly insert content before and after the content of an element, to which in this case the :after element was used to later on add the bottom-rectangle element to my home page. The nav bar used was also simplistic yet nice and easy to use - following the home page mockup I made as well. A favicon was also made as well following the home page - just as a neat little visual image option to display on the tab to show connections to World Vision</p>
        </br>
        <h4> Home Page with Montserrat Font </h4>

        <blockquote>
          <figcaption> NOTE: The image carousel feature was removed and the "Contact Us" details was later changed to a more simpler footer option - showcasing World Vision's contact details on the footer instead. The reasoning behind this was to appropriately get the user into the call-to-action of donating via showing what World Vision's impact and the user's impacts are to donating - instead of providing an image carousel of World Vision's mission which would be too prolonged and also steer away from the "Donate Now" call to action. </figcaption>

      <section>
        <h3 id = "Mobile"> Mobile Consideration for Home Page </h2> 
        <p> The mobile consideration/mockup done was also accordingly done for the Home Page in a relatively good manner, responding well as the width dimensions close in as well as being responsive to mobile devices. This however was not apparent following the addition to other pages - and the issues with properly doing responsive design for them (as shown in the self-reflection stage once again). The use of media queries and also em measurements (responsive units) within these queries paired up with the addition of the hamburger menu allowed for the following sequence of images as shown further below, alongside the media querie code showing further details of the considerations towards responsive design. </p>
        <h4> Mobile Consideration </h4>

        <blockquote>
          <figcaption> Note: The use of toggle:checked + .menu was used as a way to properly show the menu/navigation bar after the user clicks on the hamburger menu on screen. The hamburger menu dropdown should've also been better (ie the menu alignment should've been better and it should've been within an inline block element to which is something that should be addressed in the future once again</figcaption>

        <h3 id = "Flex_Box"> Flex Box Process for Our Impact and Your Impact Pages</h2> 
        <p> The use of CSS Flexbox was an essential and critical component towards the development of my "Our Impact" and "Your Impact" pages - they were aligned in different positions and required proper div tags and also flexbox css properties in order to align them accordingly (as I wanted on my mockup designs). Before the use of Flexbox, I had a hard time properly aligning them and found it impossible to do - and the discovery it had just made things much much easier, with the tool being very powerful and useful in properly aligning the images and textual elements accordingly. For instance - for my "Your Impact" page - I had used <b> according column divs - housing row divs </b> (as shown in the following images below) in order to align them properly, using the <b> flex-direction CSS property </b>to properly align them to <b> column or row elements as such </b>. Below are images showing the transition between not using Flexbox and using Flexbox alongside the outcome of the Impact Pages and the according code to it </p>
        <h4> Flexbox Transition </h4>

          <img src = "CSS Your Impact.png" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">
          </br>
        <blockquote>
          <figcaption> Note: All in all, I'm happy with the look and outcome of the two impact pages the most as the use of Flexbox - a CSS option I have never used before came in play and worked beautifully - allowing for a nicely structured design as such </figcaption>

      <section>
        <h3 id = "Donation_Pages"> Donation Pages </h2> 
        <p> Whilst the donation pages didn't come up to my standards (both semantically in terms of the HTML and CSS codes not being properly done - ie using too many margins etc instead of flexbox properties or even experimentation with CSS grid) it was overall something I liked - with the additional hover animations (as discussed in the next section) adding a bit more aesthethic and fun design. The donation pages worked via the first donate now option on the single-flow scrolling page to which linked to a seperate other donation form - allowing the user to become more situated and more likely towards the call-to-action of donating to World Vision in this case. The option to go back was also apparent on the top right if the user had decided to go back as well. Below demonstrates the donation pages alongside the code used as well - with a snippet of the CSS code for the donation image showcasing how it could've been done better (ie without margins or with use of div tags in the HTML tag for next time)</p>
        <h4> Donation Pages</h4>
        </br>
          <img src = "Donate Now.png" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">
          </br>

          <img src = "CSS Donation.png" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">
          </br>
        <blockquote>
        <figcaption> Note: I'm happy about the inclusion of the donation form on the other page (as it wasn't initially intended to be like that - instead being on the normal one-scroll page side) providing more focus towards the call-to-action of donating alongside being a nice way to properly allow the user to enter in their personal details after choosing their cause and amount. Unfortunately as a result of time constraints - the image carousel I was intially going to have whereby it would scroll past to show the benefits of donating, was not done - to which was quite a nice feature I appreciated and liked but however was not able to do as such. </figcaption>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id = "Additional_Changes"> Additional Changes and Additions </h2> 
        <p> Additional added elements were also added to my website - including the use of simple bottom hover animations alongside a footer showing World Vision's contact details instead of an image carousel - to which helped show their contact details at all times instead of being exclusive to the home page area due to the footer being fixed to the bottom section as the user scrolls bar. The addition of a button hover option was according to not only my own judgement initally but also from user feedback (as shown more in the self-reflection section) whereby suggestions towards adding it to make the website more dynamic and interesting were done. However - looking back, I should've also done more animations such as little image hover bobbles or nav bar animations as a way to be more creative and less dynamic - however I'm relatively happy about the button hover animations and also interaction with the drop-down menu and input fields for the donation-form. The footer was also a nice addition - linking to World Vision's social medias via the use of font-awesome icons alongside text detailing their contact numbers as well. Below are the according images of these additional changes and additions alongside the codes for it as well. </p>
        <h4> Footer Component </h4>
        </br>

        <blockquote>
          <figcaption> Note: All in all - I'm happy about the extra additions I made as a way to make my website more aesthethically pleasing as well as a good way to show feedback to the user (e.g. colour changes when hovering over donation amount and continue/donate now button) alongside the extra addition of the simple yet effective footer - not being too obstructive. The addition for the font-awesome icons being something new to me - were also a nice addition and conveyed World Vision's contact details properly as well</figcaption>

        <h3 id = "Self_Reflection"> Self-Reflection and Considerations </h2> 
        <p> Overall, I'm relatively happy with the outcome of my website proposal/prototype - given my time constraints alongside how I was able to accordingly follow majority of my design aesthethics and layout given the mockups - to which were useful by the end of it. I was also happy about the process towards coding it - ie doing the overall basic format first and then coding the individual pages and other responsive sizes accordingly. However - the main issue to which occurred was the lack of responsive design - to which was something addressed in user feedback but couldn't be properly addressed due to time constraints alongside the difficulty I had in managing my HTML/CSS code which could've been planned and managed more better and productively via experimenting or doing them on other pages before combining them altogether. Below are images demonstrating the final website outcome look alongside user feedback to which was and was not/couldn't be implemented or considered on time </p>
        <h4> Final Website Outcome </h4>
        </br>
          <img src = "Final Website Outcome.png" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">
          <img src = "Donate Form Page Final.png" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">

        <h4> No Proper Responsive Design </h4>
           <img src = "No Responsiveness.png" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">

        <h4>User Feedback</h4> 
        </br>
            <img src = "User Feedback.png" alt = "Sitemap2" style = "width: 100%">
            </br>
        <blockquote>
          <figcaption> For the future - I'll make sure to <b> address responsive design </b> as something to which should be considered or experimented with first (as I could've tried it on the different sections such as Our Impact on a different page of code in order to see how responsive design can be adjusted accordingly) alongside properly adding more dynamic features to the website to make it pop-out even more. However, the overall concept of the website was done well in my opinion - helping to focus on the call-to-action to donate to World Vision after knowing what the organisation's impact is and what the user's impact can be via donating. The appropriate user feedback is also something that helped a lot with the refinement of the website versions/iterations over time as well. </figcaption>
